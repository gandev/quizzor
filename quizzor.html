quizzor

submit questions and compete over answering other peoples questions

two modes

- Latter Mode (Questions stay unique)
-> Latter Mode Questions can be played against other people or by yourself
- Repeating Mode (Randomly select from all Submitted Questions)
-> small ranking improvements (grinding opportunity)

Question Ranking
(for later.. mark questions if always (xxx times) right or wrong answered -> suspicious)

answer a question and if right get points based of the questions ranking
-> question rankings are reactively recalculated when more people answer the question
-> update of question ranking and so user ranking too

User ranking

combined Ranking:
-> submitted questions (cumulated question ranking)
-> answers in Latter Mode (cumulated question ranking)
-> battle in Latter Mode (compare user ranking)
-> battle in Repeating Mode (compare user rankings)

++++

what if user submits question with wrong answer ???
-> ??? allow users to mark as wrong answer
   (check and remove scores from everybody who answered the question while wrong)
-> ??? manually checking (mark questions as approved)
